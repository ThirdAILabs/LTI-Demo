"We conducted our audits in accordance with the Korean Standards on Auditing (“KSAs”). Our  responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the  Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the  Company in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the consolidated  financial statements in the Republic of Korea, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in  accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and  appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.    Key Audit Matter    The key audit matter is a matter that, in our professional judgment, was of most significance in our audit of  the consolidated financial statements of the current period. This matter was addressed in the context of our"
"audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not  provide a separate opinion on this matter.    (A) Sales deduction related to sales promotion activities    Reasons why the matter was determined to be a key audit matter:    The Device eXperience (DX) business division performs sales promotion activities, such as price or volume  discounts and incentives, based on explicit or implicit agreements with customers, including retail and  telecommunication companies. As disclosed in Notes 2 (Significant Accounting Policies) and 3 (Critical  Accounting Estimates and Assumptions), these activities are recognized as deductions from revenue at the  expected payment amount.     As for the appropriateness of the revenue deduction amounts, such amounts may involve significant  management estimates and judgments. In addition, we believe that those amounts could be material to"
"management estimates and judgments. In addition, we believe that those amounts could be material to  the consolidated financial statements. As such, we determined the sales deduction related to sales  promotion activities as a key audit matter.

Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Consolidated  Financial Statements  Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the accompanying consolidated  financial statements in accordance with K-IFRS, and for such internal control as they determine is  necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material  misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.  In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management of the Company is responsible for"
"In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management of the Company is responsible for  assessing the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters  related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either  intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.  Those charged with governance are responsible for overseeing the Company’s financial reporting  process.  Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements  Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements  as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s  report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee"
"that an audit conducted in accordance with KSAs will always detect a material misstatement when it  exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the  aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the  basis of these consolidated financial statements.  As part of an audit in accordance with KSAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain  professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:  • Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting"
"risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or - 2 - the override of internal control.  • Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control. • Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management. • Conclude on the appropriateness of the management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company’s ability to continue as a"

If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern. • Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation. • Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or"
"Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Company to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We are solely responsible for our audit opinion. We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned  scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in  internal control that we identify during our audit.  We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant  ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other  matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related  safeguards."
"safeguards.  From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that  were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and  are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or  regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we  determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of  doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. and its subsidiaries    NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS    - 28 -  2.3 Consolidation    The Company prepares the consolidated financial statements in accordance with Korean IFRS 1110 Consolidated Financial  Statements.    (A) Subsidiaries"
"Statements.    (A) Subsidiaries    Subsidiaries are all entities (including the special purpose entities) over which the Company has control. The Company  controls the corresponding investee when it is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee  and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee. Consolidation of a subsidiary begins from the  date the Company obtains control of a subsidiary and ceases when the Company loses control of the subsidiary.    The Company applies the acquisition method to account for business combinations. The consideration transferred is measured  at the fair values of the assets transferred, and identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in  a business combination are initially measured at their fair values at the acquisition date. The Company recognizes any non-"
"controlling interest in the acquiree on an acquisition-by-acquisition basis in the event of liquidation at the non-controlling  interest’s proportionate share of the recognized amounts of acquiree’s identifiable net assets. Acquisition-related costs are  expensed as incurred.    The excess of consideration transferred, of any non-controlling interest in the acquired entity, and acquisition-date fair value  of any previous equity interest in the acquired entity over the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired is recorded as  goodwill. If those amounts are less than the fair value of the net identifiable assets of the business acquired, the difference is  recognized directly in the profit or loss as a bargain purchase.    Balances of receivables and payables, income and expenses and unrealized gains or losses on transactions between the entities  within the Company are eliminated. Accounting policies of subsidiaries are changed where necessary to ensure consistency"
"with the policies adopted by the Company.     (B) Changes in ownership interests in subsidiaries without change of control    Transactions with non-controlling interests that do not result in loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions – that  is, as transactions with the owners in their capacity as owners. The difference between the fair value of any consideration paid  and the relevant share acquired of the carrying value of net assets of the subsidiary is recorded in equity. Gains or losses on  disposals of non-controlling interests are also recorded in equity.    (C) Disposal of subsidiaries    If the Company loses control of a subsidiary, any investment continuously retained in the subsidiary is re-measured at its fair  value at the date when control is lost and any resulting differences are recognized in profit or loss. Such fair value becomes"
"the initial carrying amount for the subsequent measurement of the retained interest accounted for as an associate, joint venture,  or financial asset. In addition, any amounts previously recognized in other comprehensive income in respect of such entity are  accounted as if the Company had directly disposed of the related assets or liabilities. As a result, the previously recognized  other comprehensive income are reclassified into profit or loss or equity.    (D) Non-controlling interests    Each component of profit or loss and other comprehensive income is attributed to owners of the parent and to non-controlling  interests. Total comprehensive income is attributed to owners of the parent and to non-controlling interests even if this results  in a negative balance of non-controlling interests.        Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. and its subsidiaries    NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS    - 29 -  (E) Associates"
"NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS    - 29 -  (E) Associates    Associates are all entities over which the Company has significant influence but does not have control, generally investees of  which from 20% to 50% voting shares are owned by the Company. Investments in associates are accounted for using the  equity method of accounting, after initially being recognized at cost. Unrealized gains on transactions between the Company  and its associates are eliminated to the extent of the Company’s interest in the associates. If the Company’s share of losses of  an associate equals or exceeds its interest in the associate (including long-term interests that, in substance, form part of the  Company’s net investment in the associate), the Company discontinues recognizing its share of further losses. After the  Company’s interest is reduced to zero, additional losses are provided for, and a liability is recognized, only to the extent that"
"the Company has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate. If there is objective  evidence of impairment for the investment in the associate, the Company recognizes the difference between the recoverable  amount of the associate and its carrying amount as an impairment loss. If an associate uses accounting policies other than  those of the Company for like transactions and events in similar circumstances, adjustments shall be made, if necessary, to  make the associate’s accounting policies conform to those of the Company when the associate’s financial statements are used  by the entity in applying the equity method.    (F) Joint arrangements    A joint arrangement of which two or more parties have joint control is classified as either a joint operation or a joint venture.  A joint operator has rights to the assets, and obligations for the liabilities, relating to the joint operation and recognizes the"
"assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses relating to its interest in a joint operation. A joint venturer has rights to the net assets  relating to the joint venture and accounts for that investment using the equity method.    2.4 Foreign Currency Translation    (A) Functional and presentation currency    Items included in the consolidated financial statements of each of the Company’s entities are measured using the currency of  the primary economic environment in which each entity operates (the “functional currency”). The consolidated financial  statements are presented in Korean won, which is the parent company’s functional and presentation currency.    (B) Transactions and balances    Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the  transactions or valuation where items are re-measured. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of"
"such transactions and from the translation at year-end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign  currencies are recognized in profit or loss. Exchange differences arising on non-monetary financial assets and liabilities such  as equity instruments at fair value through profit or loss and equity instruments at fair value through other comprehensive  income are recognized in profit or loss and other comprehensive income, respectively, as part of the fair value gain or loss.    (C) Translation into the presentation currency    The results and financial position of all the foreign entities that have a functional currency different from the presentation  currency of the Company are translated into the presentation currency as follows:      Assets and liabilities for each consolidated statement of financial position presented are translated at the closing rate at  the end of the reporting date.  "
"the end of the reporting date.    Income and expenses for each consolidated statement of profit or loss are translated at average exchange rates, unless  this average is not a reasonable approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates prevailing on the transaction dates,  in which case income and expenses are translated at the as-of rate on the dates of the transactions.    All resulting exchange differences are recognized in other comprehensive income.  Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. and its subsidiaries    NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS    - 30 -  2.5 Cash and Cash Equivalents    Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, deposits held at call with banks, and other short-term investment assets with  high liquidity that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of change in value.    2.6 Financial Assets    (A)  Classification"
"2.6 Financial Assets    (A)  Classification    From January 1, 2018, the initial application date for Korean IFRS 1109 Financial Instruments, the Company classifies its  financial assets in the following measurement categories:    -  Financial assets measured at fair value (changes in fair value recognized in either other comprehensive income, or profit or loss)  -  Financial assets measured at amortized cost.    The classification depends on the Company’s business model for managing the financial assets and the contractual terms of  the cash flows.    For financial assets measured at fair value, gains and losses will either be recorded in profit or loss or other comprehensive  income. For investments in debt instruments, this will depend on the business model in which the investment is held. The  Company reclassifies debt investments only when its business model for managing those assets changes."
"For investments in equity instruments that are not held for trading, classification will depend on whether the Company has  made an irrevocable election at the time of initial recognition to account for the equity investment at fair value through other  comprehensive income. Changes in fair value of the investments in equity instruments that are not elected to be accounted for  as other comprehensive income are recognized in profit or loss.       (B)  Measurement    At initial recognition, the Company measures a financial asset at its fair value. In the case of financial asset not measured at  fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the financial asset or the  issuance of the financial liabilities are added to its fair value. Transaction costs of financial assets carried at fair value through  profit or loss are expensed in profit or loss."
profit or loss are expensed in profit or loss.    Hybrid (combined) contracts with embedded derivatives are considered in their entirety when determining whether their cash  flows solely consist of the payments of principal and interest.    a)  Debt instruments    Subsequent measurement of debt instruments depends on the Company’s business model for managing the asset and the cash  flow characteristics of the asset. The Company classifies its debt instruments into one of the following three measurement  categories:     ① Financial assets measured at amortized cost    Assets that are held for collection of contractual cash flows where those cash flows represent solely the payments of principal  and interest are measured at amortized cost. A gain or loss on a debt investment that is subsequently measured at amortized  cost and is not part of a hedging relationship is recognized in profit or loss when the asset is derecognized or impaired. Interest
"income from these financial assets is included in ‘financial income’ using the effective interest rate method.      Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. and its subsidiaries    NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS    - 31 -  ② Financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income    Assets that are held for collection of contractual cash flows and for selling the financial assets, where the assets’ cash flows  represent solely the payments of principal and interest, are measured at fair value through other comprehensive income.  Movements in the carrying amount are taken through other comprehensive income, except for the recognition of impairment  loss (reversal of impairment loss), interest income and foreign exchange gains and losses which are recognized in profit or  loss. When the financial assets are derecognized, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognized in other comprehensive"
income is reclassified from equity to profit or loss. Interest income from these financial assets is included in ‘financial income’  using the effective interest rate method. Foreign exchange gains and losses are presented in ‘financial income’ or ‘financial  expenses’ and impairment losses are presented in ‘other non-operating expenses’.    ③ Financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss    Assets that do not meet the criteria for amortized cost or fair value through other comprehensive income are measured at fair  value through profit or loss. A gain or loss on a debt investment that is subsequently measured at fair value through profit or  loss and is not part of a hedging relationship is recognized in profit or loss and presented in the consolidated statement of  profit or loss within ‘other non-operating income’ or ‘other non-operating expenses’ in the year in which it arises.    b)  Equity instruments
"b)  Equity instruments    The Company subsequently measures all equity investments at fair value. Where the Company’s management has elected to  present fair value gains and losses on equity investments in other comprehensive income, there is no subsequent  reclassification of fair value gains and losses to profit or loss following the derecognition of the investment. When the financial  asset is derecognized, the cumulative gain or loss on valuation of financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive  income recognized in equity is reclassified to retained earnings. Dividend income from such investments continue to be  recognized in profit or loss as ‘other non-operating income’ when the right to receive the payments is established.    Changes in the fair value of financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are recognized in ‘other non-operating income’  or ‘other non-operating expenses’ in the consolidated statements of profit or loss as applicable.     (C)"
"(C)  Impairment    The Company assesses on a forward-looking basis the expected credit losses associated with its debt instruments carried at  amortized cost and fair value through other comprehensive income. The impairment methodology applied depends on whether  there has been a significant increase in credit risk. For trade receivables, the Company applies the simplified approach, which  requires expected lifetime losses to be recognized from initial recognition of the receivables.    (D)  Recognition and derecognition    Regular way purchases and sales of financial assets are recognized or derecognized on a trade date basis. Financial assets are  derecognized when the rights to receive cash flows from the financial assets have expired or have been transferred and the  Company has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership. If a transfer does not result in derecognition"
"because the Company has retained substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the transferred asset, the Company  continues to recognize the transferred asset in its entirety and recognizes a financial liability for the consideration received.  The Company classifies the financial liability as ‘borrowings’ in the consolidated statement of financial position.        Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. and its subsidiaries    NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS    - 32 -  (E)  Offsetting of financial instruments    Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount is reported in the statements of financial position when there is a  legally enforceable right to offset the recognized amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis or realize the assets  and settle the liability simultaneously. The legally enforceable right must not be contingent on future events and must be"
"enforceable in the normal course of business, even in the event of default, insolvency or bankruptcy of the Company or the  counterparty.    2.7 Trade Receivables    Trade receivables are amounts due from customers for inventories sold or services performed in the ordinary course of business.  If collection is expected within one year or less, they are classified as current assets. If collection is expected beyond one year,  they are presented as non-current assets. Trade receivables are recognized initially at transaction price and subsequently  measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method, less loss allowance, unless the trade receivables bear significant  financial component.    2.8 Inventories    Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Cost is determined using the average cost method, except  for materials in transit. The cost of finished goods and work in progress comprises raw materials, direct labor, other direct"
"costs and related production overheads (based on normal operating capacity). It excludes costs of idle plant and abnormal  waste. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less applicable variable selling  expenses.    The Company regularly estimates the changes in future customer demand in the products that may cause a significant change  in the valuation allowance and recognizes the valuation allowance if there is any case such as excess, obsolescence and decline  in market value. Loss on valuation of inventories is recorded as cost of sales.    2.9 Property, Plant and Equipment    Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. Historical  cost includes expenditures that are directly attributable to the acquisition. Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying"
"amount or recognized as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated  with the cost will flow to the Company and the cost can be measured reliably. The carrying amounts of the replaced parts are  derecognized and the repairs and maintenance expenses are recognized in profit or loss in the period they are incurred.    Depreciation on tangible assets is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate the difference between their cost and  their residual values over their estimated useful lives. Land is not depreciated. Costs that are directly attributable to the  acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset, including capitalized interest costs, form part of the cost of that  asset and are amortized over the estimated useful lives.    The Company’s policy is that property, plant and equipment should be depreciated over the following estimated useful lives:      Estimated useful lives  Buildings and structures"
"Estimated useful lives  Buildings and structures  15, 30 years  Machinery and equipment  5 years  Other  5 years        Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. and its subsidiaries    NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS    - 33 -  The depreciation method, residual values and useful lives of property, plant and equipment are reviewed, and adjusted if  appropriate, at the end of each reporting period. An asset’s carrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable  amount if the asset’s carrying amount is greater than its estimated recoverable amount. Gains and losses on disposals are  determined by comparing the proceeds with the carrying amount and are recognized within the consolidated statement of  profit or loss as ‘other non-operating income’ or ‘other non-operating expenses’.    2.10 Borrowing Costs     General and specific borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying"
"asset are capitalized during the period of time that is required to complete and prepare the asset for its intended use. Investment  income earned on the temporary investment of specific borrowings pending their expenditure on qualifying assets is deducted  from the borrowing costs eligible for capitalization. Other borrowing costs are expensed in the period in which they are  incurred.    2.11 Intangible Assets    Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the Company’s share of the net identifiable  assets of the acquired subsidiaries, associates, joint ventures and businesses at the date of acquisition. Goodwill on an  acquisition of businesses is included in intangible assets and goodwill on an acquisition of associates and joint ventures’ shares  is included in the investments in associates and joint ventures.    Intangible assets, except for goodwill, are initially recognized at their historical cost and carried at cost less accumulated"
"amortization and accumulated impairment losses.    Internally generated development costs are the aggregate costs recognized after meeting the asset recognition criteria,  including technical feasibility, and determined to have future economic benefits. Membership rights and certain trademarks  are regarded as intangible assets with an indefinite useful life and not amortized because there is no foreseeable limit to the  period over which the assets are expected to be utilized. However, the Company records impairment based on its reasonable  estimation of the benefits associated with the membership rights and assessment of impairment indicators, such as a decline  in the market value. Intangible assets with definite useful lives such as trademarks, licenses, and other intangible assets, are  amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives.    The Company’s policy is that intangible assets should be amortized over the following estimated useful lives:"
"Estimated useful lives  Development costs  2 years  Trademarks, licenses and other intangible assets  3 - 25 years    2.12 Impairment of Non-Financial Assets    Goodwill or intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not subject to amortization and are tested annually for impairment.  Assets that are subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that  the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the asset’s carrying  amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell and  value in use. For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there are separately  identifiable cash flows (cash-generating units). Non-financial assets other than goodwill that suffered an impairment are"
"reviewed for possible reversal of the impairment at the end of each reporting period.        Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. and its subsidiaries    NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS    - 34 -  2.13 Assets Held-for-Sale (Disposal Group)    Non-current assets (or disposal groups) are classified as assets held-for-sale when their carrying amount is to be recovered  principally through a sale transaction and the sale is considered highly probable. The assets are measured at the lower of their  carrying amount and the fair value less costs to sell. Gain or loss on disposal is determined by comparing the proceeds with  the carrying amount of relevant assets, and is recognized in the statements of profit or loss as ‘other non-operating income’ or  ‘other non-operating expenses’.      2.14 Financial Liabilities    (A)  Classification and measurement    The Company shall classify all financial liabilities as financial liabilities measured subsequently at amortized cost, except for"
"the following:    -  Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss. Such liabilities, including derivatives that are liabilities, shall be  subsequently measured at fair value.   -  Financial liabilities that arise when a transfer of a financial asset does not qualify for derecognition or when the continuing  involvement approach applies. Such financial liabilities are measured based on the methodology described in Note 2.6  Financial Assets.   -  Financial guarantee contracts. After the initial recognition, an issuer of such a contract shall subsequently measure it at  the higher of:  (a) The amount of the loss allowance determined based on the expected credit losses.   (b) The amount initially recognized less the cumulative amount of income recognized in accordance with the principles  of Korean IFRS 1115 Revenue from Contracts with Customers, when appropriate.  -"
"of Korean IFRS 1115 Revenue from Contracts with Customers, when appropriate.  -  Commitments to provide loan at below-market interest rate. An issuer of such a commitment shall subsequently measure  it at the higher of:  (a) The amount of the loss allowance determined based on the expected credit losses.   (b) The amount initially recognized less the cumulative amount of income recognized in accordance with the principles  of Korean IFRS 1115 Revenue from Contracts with Customers, when appropriate.  -  Contingent consideration recognized by an acquirer in a business combination to which Korean IFRS 1103 Business  Combinations applies. Such contingent consideration shall subsequently be measured at fair value with changes  recognized in profit or loss.    (B)  Derecognition    Financial liabilities are removed from the consolidated statements of financial position when it is extinguished; for example,"
"when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged or cancelled or expired or when the terms of an existing financial  liability are substantially modified. The difference between the carrying amount of a financial liability extinguished or  transferred to another party and the consideration paid (including any non-cash assets transferred or liabilities assumed) is  recognized in profit or loss.     2.15 Trade Payables    Trade payables are amounts due to suppliers for inventories purchased or services received in the ordinary course of business.  If payment is expected to be made within 12 months, they are classified as current liabilities. If not, they are presented as non- current liabilities. Non-current trade payables are recognized initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortized  cost using the effective interest method.         Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. and its subsidiaries    NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS    - 35 -  2.16 Borrowings"
"NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS    - 35 -  2.16 Borrowings    Borrowings are recognized initially at fair value, net of transaction costs, and are subsequently measured at amortized cost.  Any difference between cost and the redemption value is recognized in the consolidated statement of profit or loss over the  period of the borrowings using the effective interest method. If the Company has an indefinite right to defer payment for a  period longer than 12 months after the end of the reporting date, such liabilities are recorded as non-current liabilities,  otherwise, they are recorded as current liabilities.     2.17 Provisions and Contingent Liabilities    A provision is recognized when the Company has present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, it is  probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable"
estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. Provisions are not recognized for future operating losses.    Provisions are measured at present value of the expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation using a pre-tax  rate that reflects the current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the obligation. The increase  in the provision due to the passage of time is recognized as interest expense.    The Company discloses a contingent liability if there is a possible obligation from past events in which the existence may only  be identified through the occurrence of uncertain future events; or there is a present obligations that the possibility on the  outflow of economic resources is uncertain; or the amount of economic resources required to settle the present obligation  cannot be reasonably estimated.     2.18 Employee Benefits
"cannot be reasonably estimated.     2.18 Employee Benefits    The Company has a variety of retirement pension plans including a defined benefit plan and a defined contribution plan.     A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the Company pays fixed contributions into a separate fund. The  Company has no legal or constructive obligation to pay further contributions if the fund does not hold sufficient assets to pay  all employees the benefits relating to employee service received in the current and prior periods. For a defined contribution  plans, the Company pays contributions to annuity plans that are managed either publicly or privately on a mandatory,  contractual or voluntary basis. The Company has no further future payment obligations once the contributions have been paid.  The contributions are recognized as employee benefit expense when they are due. Prepaid contributions are recognized as an"
"asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in the future payments is available.    A defined benefit plan is a pension plan that is not a defined contribution plan. Typically, a defined benefit plan establishes  an amount of pension benefit that an employee will receive upon retirement, usually dependent on one or more factors such  as age, years of service and compensation. The liability (asset) recognized in the consolidated statement of financial position  with respect to the defined benefit pension plan is the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the end of the reporting  period less the fair value of plan assets. The defined benefit obligation is calculated annually by independent actuaries using  the projected unit credit method. The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated  future cash outflows using the interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the"
"benefits will be paid and that have the terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related pension obligation.    Actuarial gains and losses resulting from the changes in actuarial assumptions, and the differences between the previous  actuarial assumptions and what has actually occurred, are recognized in other comprehensive income in the period in which  they were incurred. When plan amendments, curtailments and settlements occur, past service costs or gain or loss from  settlements are immediately recognized in profit or loss.        Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. and its subsidiaries    NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS    - 36 -  2.19 Financial Guarantee Contract    Financial guarantee contracts are contracts that require the issuer to make specified payments to reimburse the holder for a  loss it incurs because a specified debtor fails to make payments when due."
"loss it incurs because a specified debtor fails to make payments when due.     The liability is initially measured at fair value and then subsequently measured at the higher of the following, and is recognized  in the consolidated statements of financial position within ‘other financial liabilities’:    -  the amount determined in accordance with the expected credit loss model and   -  the amount initially recognized less the cumulative amount of income recognized in accordance with Korean IFRS 1115  Revenue from Contracts with Customers, where appropriate.    2.20 Current and Deferred Tax    The tax expense for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Current and deferred tax is recognized in profit or loss, except  to the extent that it relates to the items recognized in other comprehensive income or directly in equity. The tax expense is  calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the end of the reporting period."
"Deferred tax is recognized for temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying  amounts as expected tax consequences at the recovery or settlement of the carrying amounts of those assets and liabilities.  However, deferred tax assets and liabilities are not recognized if they arise from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a  transaction other than a business combination that, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting nor taxable  profit. Deferred tax assets are recognized only to the extent that it is probable that a future taxable profit will be available  against which the temporary differences can be utilized.    A deferred tax liability is recognized for taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates,  and interests in joint ventures, except to the extent that the Company is able to control the timing of the reversal of the"
"temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. In addition, a  deferred tax asset is recognized for deductible temporary differences arising from such investments to the extent that it is  probable the temporary difference will reverse in the foreseeable future and taxable profit will be available against which the  temporary difference can be utilized.    Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset the current tax assets against the  current tax liabilities and when the deferred income tax assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation  authority on either the same taxable entity or different taxable entities with an intention to settle the balances on a net basis.    2.21 Derivative Instruments     The Company initially recognizes rights and obligations from derivative contracts as assets and liabilities at fair value. Gain"
"or loss arising from these contracts are recognized in profit or loss. Qualified hedged amount from cash flow hedge and hedge  of a net investment in a foreign operation is deferred in equity.      The Company applies cash flow hedge accounting to hedge the price risk associated with inventory purchase and other. The  effective portion of changes in fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges is recognized in  other comprehensive income, and the ineffective portion is recognized in financial income or expenses.    2.22 Dividend    Dividend is recognized as a liability when approved by the Company’s shareholders.        Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. and its subsidiaries    NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS    - 37 -  2.23 Share Capital    Ordinary shares and preference shares with no repayment obligations are classified as equity. When the Company or a"
"subsidiary acquires the Company’s ordinary shares, the acquisition costs, including direct transaction costs, are deducted from  equity until the redemption or reissuance as treasury shares. Consideration received on the reissuance of treasury shares is  credited to equity attributable to owners of the parent company.     2.24 Revenue Recognition    Revenue mainly comprises the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for the sale of goods in the ordinary  course of the Company’s activities. Revenue is shown net of value-added tax, returns, sales incentives and discounts and after  eliminating intercompany transactions.    The Company applied Korean IFRS 1115 Revenue from Contracts with Customers to the annual period beginning January 1,  2018. The Company shall recognize revenue in accordance with Korean IFRS 1115 Revenue from Contracts with Customers  by applying the following 5 steps: ① Identify the contracts with the customers, ② Identify the separate performance"
"obligations, ③ Determine the transaction price of the contract, ④ Allocate the transaction price to each of the separate  performance obligations, and ⑤ Recognize the revenue as each performance obligation is satisfied.    (A)  Identification of performance obligations    The Company exports various products and merchandise in accordance with Incoterms Group C trading conditions (Incoterms  CIF and other). Since the seller provides the shipping service after the control of the product or merchandise has been  transferred to the customer, the shipping service (including insurance) is recognized as a separate performance obligation.    (B)  Performance obligations satisfied over time    The Company delivers products to customers and installs them in accordance with the system air conditioner contracts awarded  by the Public Procurement Service. According to Korean IFRS 1115 Revenue from Contracts with Customers the Company"
"should recognize revenue over time if the Company creates or enhances an asset (for example, work in progress) that the  customer controls as the asset is created or enhanced. The Company recognizes the revenue from system air conditioner  installation over time as the customer controls the outcome of the service.    (C)  Variable consideration    The Company estimates amount of variable consideration by using the ‘expected value method’ or the ‘most likely amount  method’, depending on which method the Company expects to better predict the amount of consideration. The Company  recognizes revenue only to the extent that it is highly probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue  recognized will not occur, and classifies the amount which the Company does not expect to be entitled as contract liabilities.     The Company measures refund liability at the amount of consideration received for which the Company does not expect to be"
"entitled. The Company has a right to recover the product from the customer when the customer exercises his right of return  and recognizes an asset and a corresponding adjustment to cost of sales. The asset is measured with reference to the former  carrying amount of the product less the costs to recover the products.    (D)  Allocation of the transaction price    The transaction price in an arrangement must be allocated to each separate performance obligation based on the relative  standalone selling prices of the goods or services being provided to a customer. The Company determines the standalone  selling price for each separate performance obligation by using methods such as the ‘adjusted market assessment approach’.      Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. and its subsidiaries    NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS    - 38 -  2.25 Leases    A lease is a contract, whereby the lessor conveys to the lessee, the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period"
"of time in exchange for consideration.    At inception of a contract, the Company assesses whether the contract is, or contains, a lease. However, the Company did not  reassess all contracts at initial application of Korean IFRS 1116 Leases because the Company applied the practical expedient  to contracts entered into before January 1, 2019.    For a contract that is, or contains, a lease, both lessee and lessor account for each lease component within the contract as a  lease separately from the non-lease components of the contract. In lessee accounting, however, the Company does not account  for them separately but instead applies the practical expedient to account for each lease component and any associated non- lease components as a single lease component.     (A)  Lessee accounting    The Company recognizes a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying leased asset and a lease liability"
"representing its obligation to make lease payments at the commencement date of the lease.    The right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost and subsequently measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and  accumulated impairment losses, adjusted for the remeasurement of lease liability. The right-of-use asset is depreciated over  the shorter of the asset’s useful life and the lease term from the commencement date of the lease and is classified as ‘property,  plant and equipment’ in the consolidated financial statements.     At the commencement date, the lease liability is measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at that  date. When measuring the present value, the lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease. If such  implicit rate cannot be readily determined, the Company uses the Company’s incremental borrowing rate. The lease liability"
"is subsequently increased by the amount of interest expenses recognized on the lease liability and reduced by the lease  payments made. Lease liabilities are remeasured when the future lease payments are changed due to the following:       Changes in an index or rate    Changes in amounts expected to be payable by the lessee under the residual value guarantees    Changes in the assessment of whether a purchase option or an option to renew is reasonably certain to be exercised, or    Changes in the assessment of whether it is reasonably certain that an option to terminate the lease will not be exercised.    Lease liabilities are classified as ‘current portion of long-term liabilities’ and/or ‘long-term borrowings’ in the consolidated  financial statements.     The Company elected the practical expedient for short-term leases (leases that have a lease term of 12 months or less at the"
"commencement date) and leases of low-value assets (leases for which the underlying asset is valued at USD 5,000 or less),  and the lease payments are recognized as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.    (B)  Lessor accounting    The accounting treatment as a lessor did not change significantly from the Korean IFRS 1116 Leases initially applied on  January 1, 2019.     The Company classifies a lease as a finance lease if it transfers substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership  at the inception of the lease. A lease other than a finance lease is classified as an operating lease. Lease income from operating  leases is recognized in income on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Initial direct costs incurred by the lessor in  negotiating and arranging an operating lease are added to the carrying amount of the leased asset and recognized as an expense  over the lease term on the same basis as the lease income."
"over the lease term on the same basis as the lease income.  Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. and its subsidiaries    NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS    - 39 -  2.26 Government Grants    Government grants are recognized at their fair values when there is reasonable assurance that the grant will be received and  the Company will comply with the conditions attached to it. Government grants relating to costs are deferred and recognized  in the consolidated statements of profit or loss over the period necessary to match the costs they are intended to compensate.  Government grants relating to assets are recognized in liabilities as deferred income government grants, and depreciated over  the expected lives of the related assets, and are credited to the consolidated statements of profit or loss.    2.27 Earnings per Share    Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the net profit for the period available to the ordinary shareholders by the"
"weighted-average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year.     Diluted earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit for the year attributable to owners of the parent company from  the consolidated statements of profit or loss by the weighted-average number of ordinary shares outstanding and potential  dilutive shares. Potential dilutive shares are used in the calculation of dilutive earnings per share only when they have dilutive  effects.     2.28 Reportable Segments    Reportable segments are disclosed in a manner consistent with the reporting provided to the chief operating decision-maker.  The chief operating decision-maker is responsible for making strategic decisions on resource allocation and assessing  performance of the reportable segments. The Management Committee, which makes strategic decisions, is regarded as the  chief operating decision-maker.      2.29 Convenience Translation into United States Dollar Amounts"

Critical Accounting Estimates and Assumptions    The Company makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future. The estimates and assumptions are continuously  assessed, considering historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be  reasonable under the circumstances. The resulting accounting estimates will, by definition, seldom equal the related actual  results. In particular, the spread of COVID-19 in the year ended December 31, 2020 may result in changes to the Company’s  assumptions and estimates but its potential financial impact cannot be reasonably estimated as of the reporting date.    The estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets"
"and liabilities within the next financial year are addressed below.    (A) Revenue recognition    A refund liability and a right to the returned goods are recognized for the products expected to be returned at the time of sale.  Accumulative experience is used to estimate such returns at the time of sale at a portfolio level (through expected value  method), and the Company’s revenue is affected by the changes in expected return rate.     Sales of goods are recognized based on the considerations specified in the contract, net of sales incentives, when control of  the products has transferred. The sales deduction, which affects the Company’s revenue, is reasonably estimated based on the  historical experience and past contracts.    (B) Provision for warranty    The Company recognizes provision for warranty on products sold. The Company accrues provision for warranty based on the"
"best estimate of amounts necessary to settle future and existing claims at the end of each reporting period. The amounts are  estimated based on the past experience.    (C) Fair value of financial instruments     The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market is determined by using a variety of methods and  assumptions that are mainly based on market conditions existing at the end of each reporting period.    (D) Impairment of financial assets    The loss allowance for financial assets are based on assumptions about risk of default and expected loss rates. The Company  uses judgement in making these assumptions and selecting the inputs to the impairment calculation based on the Company’s  past history, existing market conditions as well as forward looking estimates at the end of each reporting period.    (E) Lease    In determining the lease term, the Company considers all facts and circumstances that create an economic incentive to exercise"
"an extension option, or not to exercise a termination option. Extension options (or periods after termination options) are only  included in the lease term if the lease is reasonably certain to be extended (or not terminated).    The lease term is reassessed if an option is actually exercised (or not exercised) or the Company becomes obliged to exercise  (or not exercise) it. The Company reassesses whether it is reasonably certain to exercise an extension option (or not to exercise  such option) upon the occurrence of either a significant event or a significant change in circumstances that is within the control  of the lessee.        Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. and its subsidiaries    NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS    - 41 -  (F) Net defined benefit liabilities (assets)    The net defined benefit liabilities (assets) depend on a number of factors that are determined on an actuarial basis using a"
"number of assumptions including the discount rate. Any changes in these assumptions will impact the carrying amount of the  net defined benefit liability. The Company, in consideration of the interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds, determines  the appropriate discount rate at the end of each year. This is the interest rate that is used to determine the present value of  estimated future cash outflows expected to be required to settle the net defined benefit liabilities (assets). The principal  actuarial assumptions associated with the net defined benefit liabilities (assets) are based on the current market expectations.    (G) Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets that have an indefinite useful life    At the end of each reporting period, the Company tests whether goodwill and intangible assets that have an indefinite useful  life have become impaired by comparing the carrying amounts of assets or cash-generating units to the recoverable amounts."
"The recoverable amounts of assets or cash-generating units have been determined based on value-in-use calculations, and  these calculations are based on estimates.    (H) Income taxes    Income taxes on the Company’s taxable income from operating activities are subject to various tax laws and determinations  of each tax authority across various countries throughout the world. There is uncertainty in determining the eventual tax effects  on the taxable income from operating activities. The Company has recognized current tax and deferred tax at the end of the  fiscal year based on the best estimate of future taxes payable as a result of operating activities. However, the resulting deferred  income tax assets and liabilities may not equal the actual future taxes payable and such difference may impact the current tax  and deferred income tax assets and liabilities upon the determination of eventual tax effects."
"and deferred income tax assets and liabilities upon the determination of eventual tax effects.    Regarding taxes payable in Korea, if a certain portion of taxable income is not used for investments or for increases in wages  or dividends, in accordance with the Tax System For Recirculation of Corporate Income, the Company is liable to pay  additional income tax calculated based on the Korean tax law. The current and deferred taxes at the end of the fiscal year are  based on the best estimate of future taxes payable, which can differ from the actual future taxes payable as a result of changes  in investments, wages and dividends; this results in an additional uncertainty in measuring the final tax effects.     The Company assesses uncertainty over a tax treatment. When the Company concludes it is not probable that the taxation  authority will accept an uncertain tax treatment, the Company will reflect the effect of uncertainty for each uncertain tax"
"treatment by using either of the following methods, depending on which method the Company expects to better predict the  resolution of the uncertainty:     -  The most likely amount: the single most likely amount in a range of possible outcomes.  -  The expected value: the sum of the probability-weighted amounts in a range of possible outcomes.

The major currencies that are exposed to the foreign exchange risk are the US dollar, Euro, and  Indian Rupee.    The Company focuses on minimizing the impact of the foreign exchange fluctuation by maintaining the equal amount of  assets and liabilities denominated in each foreign currency, irrespective of the foreign exchange fluctuation considerations.

The Company’s position with regard to interest  rate risk exposure is mainly driven by its floating interest rate debt obligations and interest-bearing deposits. The Company  implemented policies and operates to minimize uncertainty arising from changes in interest rates and financial expenses.

"(B)   Credit risk    Credit risk arises during the normal course of transactions and investing activities where clients or other parties fail to discharge  an obligation.

Adequate insurance coverage  is maintained for trade receivables related to the trading partners situated in higher risk countries.    Credit risk can arise from transactions with financial institutions which include financial instrument transactions such as cash  and cash equivalents, deposits, and derivative instruments.

The Cash Pooling program allows the sharing of  surplus funds among the entities and contributes to minimizing the liquidity risk and strengthening the Company’s competitive  position by reducing capital operation expenses and financial expenses.
